## Project files
The code for the initial deliverable (Mars News) is found in part_1_mars_news.ipynb, while part_2_mars_weather.ipynb includes the code for the second deliverable (Mars Weather Data). The Cleaned_Data directory houses the sanitized data from Deliverable 2, stored in a CSV file. Additionally, the Output directory contains PNG exports of the analysis from Deliverable 2, which are also included in this README file.
